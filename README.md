# Subnational-COVID-19-vaccination
This project is to investigate the vaccination rate for each country. 

This project is inspired by wonderful project https://github.com/sociepy/covid19-vaccination-subnational. I used the vaccinations.txt file in this project. The detailed instruction can refer https://github.com/sociepy/covid19-vaccination-subnational/blob/main/README.md
