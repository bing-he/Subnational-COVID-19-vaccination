# Subnational-COVID-19-vaccination
This project is to investigate the vaccination rate for each country. 

This project is inspired by wonderful project https://github.com/sociepy/covid19-vaccination-subnational. I used the vaccinations.txt file in this project. The detailed instruction can refer https://github.com/sociepy/covid19-vaccination-subnational/blob/main/README.md

Figure 1 (Vaccination2.pdf) shows the vaccination rate for each country. The upper 20 small figure shows the subnational total vaccination variations per 100 people in different countries between 01/21/2021 and 02/10/2021. The average rate for each country is labeled at the upper left corner. The bottom left histogram shows the average rate for each country. The bottom right histogram plots the days to reach 80% of people vaccinated under the current injection rate.

Figure 2 (US_Vaccination_rate.pdf) shows the vaccintaion rate for each states in US.
